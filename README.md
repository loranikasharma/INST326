# INST326
Final Project for INST326

This python project is a fun guessing game where the user has to guess a President based off of some information our program provides. 

The code reads in a csv file, turns it into dataframe using pandas then stores the users guesses
to see if they have guessed correctly or incorrectly (providing hints for each 
incorrect answer).

The project consists of two main classes a User class that keeps track of the users attempts, name and score and a Game class that keeps track of the game state and will compare values to the user class
